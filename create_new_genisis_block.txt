new procedure to create new genesisblock using sacarlson git build
1. get epoc time in unix with date +%s
2. use this number to edit block_nTime= value in bitcoin.config file
3. find a headline article in the news or paper to create a new string value to put in pszTimestamp in bitcoin.config example
pszTimestamp="The Times 04/Apr/2011 Tornadoes and vicious winds left 17 people dead across four states"
4. set values of testnet_config=1, gennewblock=1,testnet=1, printtoconsole=1  in bitcoin.config 
5. start bitcoind -noirc -testnet -datadir=/home/youruser/.bitcoin/proto
   this will take some time maybe 1 hour or so for it to find a block, when it does find one you will see some data
   with an error at the end.
6. with the data seen at this point edit the values in bitcoin.config for 
  block_hashMerkleRoot=
  genesisblock=
  block_nTime=
  block_nNonce=
as seen in the data before the error line at the end.

7. now delete the testnet dir you plan to use for your new proto bitcoin and start bitcoind -noirc -testnet again
   it should start to run normaly and when exit you should now have a walet file with your new proto coin
8. you can now start to mine you new coin with the command bitcoind -noirc -testnet -gen -datadir=/home/youruser/.bitcoin/proto but to do this you will also 
   need to have another system listening on your new coins network, make sure the port listen of each match
   you should make the other system setup with the same bitcoin.config file with the same git build as the minner.
   make sure at start of the other system that the /home/youruser/.bitcoin/testnet  is deleted before start.
   optionaly you should change the -datadir= in your client so you don't damage other coins in your dir.
